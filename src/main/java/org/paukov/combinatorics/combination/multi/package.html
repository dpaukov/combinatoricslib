This package contains the multicombinations generator (combinations with repetitions).


<h3> Multi-combinations</h3>

A k-multicombination or k-combination with repetition of a finite set S is
given by a sequence of k not necessarily distinct elements of S, where order
is not taken into account.
<p>
  As an example. Suppose there are 2 types of fruits (apple and orange) at a
  grocery store, and you want to buy 3 pieces of fruit. You could select
<ul>
  <li>(apple, apple, apple)
  <li>(apple, apple, orange)
  <li>(apple, orange, orange)
  <li>(orange, orange, orange)
</ul>
<p>
  Generate 3-combinations with repetitions of the set (apple, orange).
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// Create the initial vector of (apple, orange)
ICombinatoricsVector&lt;String&gt; initialVector = Factory.createVector(new String[] {
		&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot; });

// Create a multi-combination generator to generate 3-combinations of
// the initial vector
Generator&lt;String&gt; gen = Factory.createMultiCombinationGenerator(initialVector,3);
 
// Print all possible combinations
for (ICombinatoricsVector&lt;String&gt; combination : gen) {
	System.out.println(combination);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  And the result of 4 multi-combinations
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
   CombinatoricsVector=([apple, apple, apple], size=3)
   CombinatoricsVector=([apple, apple, orange], size=3)
   CombinatoricsVector=([apple, orange, orange], size=3)
   CombinatoricsVector=([orange, orange, orange], size=3)
</pre>
