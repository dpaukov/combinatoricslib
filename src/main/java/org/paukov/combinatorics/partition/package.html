This package contains the integer partitions generator.

<p>
  In number theory, a partition of a positive integer n is a way of writing n
  as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of
  their summands are considered to be the same partition; if order matters then
  the sum becomes a composition. A summand in a partition is also called a
  part.
<p>
  <b>WARNING!</b> Be careful because number of all partitions can be very high even
  for not great given N.
<p>
  The partitions of 5 are listed below:
<ol>
  <li>1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
  <li>2 + 1 + 1 + 1
  <li>2 + 2 + 1
  <li>3 + 1 + 1
  <li>3 + 2
  <li>4 + 1
  <li>5
</ol>
<p>
  The number of partitions of n is given by the partition function p(n). In
  number theory, the partition function p(n) represents the number of possible
  partitions of a natural number n, which is to say the number of distinct (and
  order independent) ways of representing n as a sum of natural numbers.
<p>
  Let's generate all possible partitions of 5:
<p>
<blockquote>

<pre>
// Create an instance of the partition generator to generate all
// possible partitions of 5
Generator&lt;Integer&gt; gen = Factory.createPartitionGenerator(5);

// Print the partitions
for (ICombinatoricsVector&lt;Integer&gt; p : gen) {
	System.out.println(p);
}
</pre>

</blockquote>
<p>
  And the result of all 7 integer possible partitions
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
  CombinatoricsVector=([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], size=5)
  CombinatoricsVector=([2, 1, 1, 1], size=4)
  CombinatoricsVector=([2, 2, 1], size=3)
  CombinatoricsVector=([3, 1, 1], size=3)
  CombinatoricsVector=([3, 2], size=2)
  CombinatoricsVector=([4, 1], size=2)
  CombinatoricsVector=([5], size=1)
</pre>
</blockquote>
